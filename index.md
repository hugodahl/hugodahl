# WELCOME!




## Projects
Below are some projects in which I have some involvement. That involvement can range from actively following the development and providing some suggestions/bugs/features, through participating in the development, all the way to my own projects on which I am actively working to some extent.

### Personal

* [HashDocs][HashDocs Site] [(code)][HashDocs Code]: A .Net Core client to access Dash Docsets

### Community

* [Stream Deck Toolkit][]: A Dotnet Core template to build plugins for the [Elgato Stream Deck](https://elgato.com/gaming) using Dotnet Core

### Archives and Past
** Projects which would have previously fit in one of the above categories, but for which I am no longer actively participating.
